# Gaussian-Mixture-Model
Gaussian mixture models is a famous probabilistic model which can be used for clustering. Its hidden parameters can be determined by expectation-maximization algorithm. I have implement this method on Iris Data-set and Online Retail Data-set and evaluated it using internal and external evaluation methods.
